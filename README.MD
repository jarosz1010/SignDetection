# Neural Network for detecting road signs

## Tips
- install `pipreqs` for creating requirements.txt file with all project dependecies:
`pip install pipreqs`

- if some module is missing (for example SciPy), you can manually grep it from `pip freeze`:
```pip freeze | grep -i Scipy``` (-i for case-insensitive)
and then add it to the requirements.txt file

- for installing all reqs from *requirements.txt* type:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
